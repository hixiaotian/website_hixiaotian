# Designing a chess game can be an intricate task due to the complexity of the rules, different pieces, and the need to track the state of the game. Here's a simple way to approach this task.

# ## Basic Classes

# 1. **Piece**: This class would represent a general game piece. It can contain properties such as color (black or white), position on the board, and methods like `move()`, `capture()`. It can be a base class for specific types of pieces like `Pawn`, `Rook`, `Knight`, `Bishop`, `Queen`, `King` that would inherit from it and possibly override its methods or add new ones specific to a certain type of piece. 

# 2. **Player**: This class would represent a player. It can have properties like color (representing which color pieces the player controls), status (indicating if the player is in check, checkmate, etc.).

# 3. **Board**: This class would represent the chessboard. It can contain a 2D array representing the board squares, which can be populated with `Piece` objects. It could also have methods to initialize the board, check if a certain move is valid, execute a move, etc.

# 4. **Game**: This class would represent a chess game. It would contain players and the board. It can have methods for setting up a game, executing a turn, checking the game state (in progress, checkmate, stalemate), etc.

# ## Example

# Here is a high-level example structure in Python (excluding method implementation):

# ```python
class Piece:
    def __init__(self, color, position):
        self.color = color
        self.position = position

    def move(self, new_position):
        pass

class Pawn(Piece):
    pass

class Rook(Piece):
    pass

# ... other specific piece types ...

class Player:
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color
        self.status = "Normal"

class Board:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = self.initialize_board()

    def initialize_board(self):
        pass

    def validate_move(self, piece, new_position):
        pass

    def execute_move(self, piece, new_position):
        pass

class Game:
    def __init__(self, player1, player2):
        self.players = [player1, player2]
        self.board = Board()
        self.status = "In Progress"

    def setup(self):
        pass

    def execute_turn(self, player, move):
        pass

    def check_game_state(self):
        pass
# ```

# In reality, you might need to add many more classes or subclasses, or make the existing ones more complex. For instance, the `Piece` class might need additional methods for the unique movement and capture rules of each piece. The `Board` class might need more complex logic for checking the validity of moves, considering the positions of all other pieces on the board. The `Game` class might need additional logic to handle special game rules, like castling or en passant captures.

# This is a high-level design that provides a starting point, and you'd have to extend and refine it based on the specific requirements of your game.
