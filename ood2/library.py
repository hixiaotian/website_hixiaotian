# Designing a Library Management System involves creating different classes to represent various entities in the library system, such as books, patrons (users of the library), and transactions (checkouts and returns). Let's see a high-level design of such a system:

# ## Basic Classes

# 1. **Book**: This class represents a book in the library. It can have properties such as ISBN, title, author, publication year, status (available, checked out, reserved), and location in the library (such as shelf number).

# 2. **Patron**: This class represents a library user. It can have properties like patron ID, name, contact information, and a list of books currently checked out.

# 3. **Transaction**: This class represents a checkout or return operation. It can have properties like transaction ID, type (checkout or return), the patron who performed the operation, the book involved, and the date when the operation was performed.

# 4. **Library**: This class represents the library itself. It can contain a list of `Book` objects, a list of `Patron` objects, a list of `Transaction` objects, and methods for operations such as checking out a book, returning a book, adding a new book, and finding a book by ISBN.

# Here is a Python example that demonstrates these classes:

# ```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, isbn, title, author, publication_year):
        self.isbn = isbn
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.publication_year = publication_year
        self.status = "Available"
        self.location = None

class Patron:
    def __init__(self, patron_id, name, contact):
        self.patron_id = patron_id
        self.name = name
        self.contact = contact
        self.checked_out_books = []

class Transaction:
    def __init__(self, transaction_id, type, patron, book, date):
        self.transaction_id = transaction_id
        self.type = type
        self.patron = patron
        self.book = book
        self.date = date

class Library:
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = []
        self.patrons = []
        self.transactions = []

    def checkout_book(self, isbn, patron_id):
        pass

    def return_book(self, isbn, patron_id):
        pass

    def add_book(self, isbn, title, author, publication_year):
        pass

    def find_book(self, isbn):
        pass
# ```

# Again, this is a high-level and simplified design that doesn't include many practical considerations like error handling (what if a book is not found, or a patron tries to check out more books than they're allowed?), or database interactions. Also, for tracking overdue items, you might want to add an `due_date` property to the `Transaction` class and run a daily process to check for overdue books. However, this basic design provides a good starting point to build upon.
