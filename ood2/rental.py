# Designing a Car Rental System involves creating various classes to represent different entities in the system, such as Customer, Vehicle, Rental, and PricingPolicy. Here's a basic design:

# 1. **Vehicle**: This class represents a car that can be rented. It can have properties like vehicle_id, model, brand, year, mileage, price_per_day, availability, and status. Status could represent whether the vehicle is rented, available, or under maintenance.

# 2. **Customer**: This class represents a customer. It has properties like customer_id, name, address, and driver_license_number.

# 3. **Rental**: This class represents a rental transaction. It has properties like rental_id, customer_id, vehicle_id, rental_start_date, rental_end_date, and total_price. The total_price can be calculated based on the price per day of the vehicle and the number of days of the rental.

# 4. **Fleet**: This class represents the entire fleet of vehicles. It contains a list (or other suitable data structure) of all vehicles. It can have methods to add/remove vehicles to the fleet, check the availability of a vehicle, and find a vehicle by id.

# 5. **RentalSystem**: This is the main class that interacts with the other classes. It has methods to create a new customer, create a new rental transaction, calculate the price of a rental, etc.

# Here is a Python example to demonstrate these classes:

# ```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id, model, brand, year, mileage, price_per_day):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.model = model
        self.brand = brand
        self.year = year
        self.mileage = mileage
        self.price_per_day = price_per_day
        self.is_available = True


class Customer:
    def __init__(self, customer_id, name, address, driver_license_number):
        self.customer_id = customer_id
        self.name = name
        self.address = address
        self.driver_license_number = driver_license_number


class Rental:
    def __init__(self, rental_id, customer, vehicle, rental_start_date, rental_end_date):
        self.rental_id = rental_id
        self.customer = customer
        self.vehicle = vehicle
        self.rental_start_date = rental_start_date
        self.rental_end_date = rental_end_date
        self.total_price = (rental_end_date - rental_start_date).days * vehicle.price_per_day


class Fleet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vehicles = {}

    def add_vehicle(self, vehicle):
        self.vehicles[vehicle.vehicle_id] = vehicle

    def remove_vehicle(self, vehicle_id):
        if vehicle_id in self.vehicles:
            del self.vehicles[vehicle_id]

    def get_vehicle(self, vehicle_id):
        return self.vehicles.get(vehicle_id, None)


class RentalSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.customers = {}
        self.rentals = {}
        self.fleet = Fleet()

    def add_customer(self, customer):
        self.customers[customer.customer_id] = customer

    def create_rental(self, rental_id, customer_id, vehicle_id, rental_start_date, rental_end_date):
        customer = self.customers.get(customer_id, None)
        vehicle = self.fleet.get_vehicle(vehicle_id)

        if customer is None or vehicle is None or not vehicle.is_available:
            return None

        rental = Rental(rental_id, customer, vehicle, rental_start_date, rental_end_date)
        self.rentals[rental_id] = rental

        vehicle.is_available = False

        return rental
# ```

# This is a simple design and doesn't

#  include many practical considerations like error handling, vehicle maintenance, discounts, etc. For a production-level system, there will be many more aspects to consider and design.
