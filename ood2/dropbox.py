# Designing a Document Management System involves creating different classes to represent various entities in the system, such as User, Document, Version, AccessControl, and potentially more.

# ## Basic Classes

# 1. **User**: This class represents a user in the system. It can have properties like user ID, name, email, and a list of documents owned by the user.

# 2. **Document**: This class represents a document. It can have properties like document ID, name, content, owner, a list of versions, and access control list.

# 3. **Version**: This class represents a version of a document. It can have properties like version ID, document it belongs to, content, creation timestamp, and the user who made the changes.

# 4. **AccessControl**: This class represents access control for a document. It can have properties like user, document, and permissions.

# Here is a Python example that demonstrates these classes:

# ```python
import datetime
class User:
    def __init__(self, user_id, name, email):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.documents = []

class Document:
    def __init__(self, doc_id, name, owner):
        self.doc_id = doc_id
        self.name = name
        self.content = None
        self.owner = owner
        self.versions = []
        self.access_control_list = []

class Version:
    def __init__(self, version_id, doc, content, user):
        self.version_id = version_id
        self.doc = doc
        self.content = content
        self.timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()
        self.user = user

class AccessControl:
    def __init__(self, user, doc, permissions):
        self.user = user
        self.doc = doc
        self.permissions = permissions  # e.g., "read", "write", "delete"
# ```

# This is a high-level and simplified design that doesn't include many practical considerations like error handling, database interactions, or efficient search and retrieval of documents. However, this basic design provides a good starting point to build upon.

# In a production system, you might use a database to store documents and metadata, and a search engine like Elasticsearch to enable full-text search. You might use a version control system to handle versioning. Access control could be implemented using standard techniques like Access Control Lists (ACLs) or Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). For document storage, especially for large documents or binary files, you might use a blob storage system. You might also use a cache to speed up access to frequently-accessed documents.
