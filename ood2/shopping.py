# Designing an Online Shopping System involves various components interacting with each other. The key components could be represented as different classes in an object-oriented approach.

# ## Basic Classes

# 1. **Product**: This class represents a product in the inventory. It can have properties such as product ID, name, description, price, and quantity available.

# 2. **Customer**: This class represents a customer. It can have properties like customer ID, name, shipping address, email, cart, and a list of orders placed.

# 3. **Cart**: This class represents a shopping cart. It can have properties like a list of `CartItem` objects and methods to add an item, remove an item, and calculate the total cost.

# 4. **CartItem**: This class represents an item in a shopping cart. It can have properties like a `Product` object and the quantity of that product.

# 5. **Order**: This class represents an order. It can have properties like order ID, the `Customer` who placed the order, a list of `OrderItem` objects, payment status, and shipping status.

# 6. **OrderItem**: This class represents an item in an order. It can have properties like a `Product` object and the quantity of that product.

# 7. **Payment**: This class can handle payment related information and methods. It can have properties like payment id, amount, payment method, payment date and status.

# Here is a Python example that demonstrates these classes:

# ```python
class Product:
    def __init__(self, id, name, description, price, quantity):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.price = price
        self.quantity = quantity

class Customer:
    def __init__(self, id, name, address, email):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.address = address
        self.email = email
        self.cart = Cart()
        self.orders = []

class Cart:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def add_item(self, product, quantity):
        pass

    def remove_item(self, product):
        pass

    def calculate_total(self):
        pass

class CartItem:
    def __init__(self, product, quantity):
        self.product = product
        self.quantity = quantity

class Order:
    def __init__(self, id, customer, items):
        self.id = id
        self.customer = customer
        self.items = items
        self.payment_status = "Not Paid"
        self.shipping_status = "Not Shipped"

class OrderItem:
    def __init__(self, product, quantity):
        self.product = product
        self.quantity = quantity

class Payment:
    def __init__(self, id, amount, method, date):
        self.id = id
        self.amount = amount
        self.method = method
        self.date = date
        self.status = "Pending"

    def process_payment(self):
        pass
# ```

# This is a very high-level design. In a production system, you would need to handle many other considerations, such as:

# - Checking whether an item is in stock when adding to a cart or placing an order
# - Handling concurrent updates to the same product (e.g., two customers buying the last item at the same time)
# - Securing customer and payment information
# - Providing search and recommendation functionalities
# - Handling shipping, including integrating with external courier services
# - Adding administrative functions, such as managing products and processing returns

# You would likely also need to use a database to store product, customer, and order information, and your application would interact with this database to retrieve data and persist changes. This is not shown in the above example, which is intended to
